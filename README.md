# Local-Port-Monitor
Continues scan of local packets, where it is looking for UDP-Traffic & a specific destination port & only IPv4. If the criteria is met, then it saves the IP in a file. Also checks for duplicates.

## Why does this exist?
I used this to monitor the connection to game servers in a competitive game because the connection to specific servers was so unreliable, of packet loss. And it has to be something not client related. To debug this further, I used the IP-list.
