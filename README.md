# Local-Port-Monitor
Scans for local connections on specific ports and saves them

## Why does this exist?
I used this to monitor the connection to game servers in a competitive game because the connection to specific servers was so unreliable, of packet loss. And it has to be something not client related. To debug this further, I used the IP-list.
